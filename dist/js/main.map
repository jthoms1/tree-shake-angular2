Generally it is placed in a list with other\n * items. It can easily be swiped, deleted, reordered, edited, and more. An item is only required to\n * be in a [List](../../list/List) if manipulating the item via gestures is required. It requires an\n * [ItemSliding](../ItemSliding) wrapper element in order to be swiped.\n *\n *\n * ## Common Usage\n * There are a few elements that are considered items, but not all of them are styled to look the same.\n * The basic item can be written as an `<ion-item>` element or it can be added to any element by adding\n * `ion-item` as an attribute. List headers and item dividers, although styled differently, are also items\n * and can be written as `<ion-list-header>` and `<ion-item-divider>`, respectively.\n *\n * ### As an Element\n * A basic item should be written as a `<ion-item>` element when it is not clickable.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   Item\n * </ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n * A list header should be written as `<ion-list-header>`.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-list-header>\n *   List Header\n * </ion-list-header>\n * ```\n *\n * An item divider should be written as `<ion-item-divider>`.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item-divider>\n *   Item Divider\n * </ion-item-divider>\n * ```\n *\n * ### As an Attribute\n * The attribute `ion-item` should be added to a `<button>` when the item can be clicked or tapped. It\n * should be added to an `<a>` element when the item needs to contain a `href`. It can be added as an\n * attribute to any element to take on the item styling.\n *\n * ```html\n * <button ion-item (click)=\"buttonClick()\">\n *   Button Item\n * </button>\n *\n * <a ion-item href=\"https://www.ionicframework.com\">\n *   Anchor Item\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * Note: do not add `ion-item` as an attribute to an `<ion-list-header>` or `<ion-item-divider>` element\n * as they are already items and their styling will be changed to look like a basic item.\n *\n * ## Detail Arrows\n * By default, `<button>` and `<a>` elements with the `ion-item` attribute will display a right arrow icon\n * on `ios` mode. To hide the right arrow icon on either of these elements, add the `detail-none` attribute\n * to the item. To show the right arrow icon on an element that doesn't display is naturally, add the\n * `detail-push` attribute to the item.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item detail-push>\n *   Item with Detail Arrow\n * </ion-item>\n *\n * <button ion-item (click)=\"buttonClick()\">\n *   Button Item with Detail Arrow\n * </button>\n *\n * <a ion-item detail-none href=\"https://www.ionicframework.com\">\n *   Anchor Item with no Detail Arrow\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * This feature is not enabled by default for `md` and `wp` modes, but it can be enabled by setting the\n * Sass variables `$item-md-detail-push-show` and `$item-wp-detail-push-show`, respectively, to `true`.\n * It can also be disabled for ios by setting `$item-ios-detail-push-show` to `false`. See the\n * [theming documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/theming/overriding-ionic-variables/) for\n * more information on overriding Sass variables.\n *\n *\n * ## Item Placement\n * Items rely heavily on content projection to position content. The item grabs content based on the\n * element or attribute and positions it that way. This logic makes it possible to write a complex\n * item with simple, understandable markup without having to worry about styling and positioning\n * the elements.\n *\n * The below chart details the attributes item looks for and where it will place the element with\n * that attribute inside of the item:\n *\n *  | Attribute      | Description                                                                                          |\n *  |----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n *  | `item-left`    | Placed to the left of all other elements, outside of the inner item.                                 |\n *  | `item-right`   | Placed to the right of all other elements, inside of the inner item, outside of the input wrapper.   |\n *  | `item-content` | Placed to the right of any `ion-label`, inside of the input wrapper.                                 |\n *\n * ### Checkboxes, Radios and Toggles\n * [Checkboxes](../../checkbox/Checkbox) are positioned in the same place as the `item-left` attribute.\n * [Radios](../../radio/RadioButton) and [Toggles](../../toggle/Toggle) are positioned in the same place\n * as the `item-right` attribute. All of these components can be positioned differently by adding the\n * `item-left` or `item-right` attribute.\n *\n * ### Content and Inputs\n * A [Label](../../label/Label) is placed inside of the item to the left of all content and inputs. The\n * following components are all placed in the same position as the `item-content` attribute: [Select](../../select/Select),\n * [Input](../../input/Input), [TextArea](../../input/TextArea), [DateTime](../../datetime/DateTime), and\n * [Range](../../range/Range).\n *\n * Any element directly placed inside of an `<ion-item>` that does not have one of the previously mentioned\n * attributes and isn't one of the above elements will be placed inside of a [Label](../../label/Label).\n *\n *\n * @usage\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-list>\n *\n *   <ion-list-header>\n *     Header\n *

You use navigation controllers\n * to navigate to [pages](#creating_pages) in your app. At a basic level, a\n * navigation controller is an array of pages representing a particular history\n * (of a Tab for example). This array can be manipulated to navigate throughout\n * an app by pushing and popping pages or inserting and removing them at\n * arbitrary locations in history.\n *\n * The current page is the last one in the array, or the top of the stack if we\n * think of it that way.  [Pushing](#push) a new page onto the top of the\n * navigation stack causes the new page to be animated in, while [popping](#pop)\n * the current page will navigate to the previous page in the stack.\n *\n * Unless you are using a directive like [NavPush](../NavPush/), or need a\n * specific NavController, most times you will inject and use a reference to the\n * nearest NavController to manipulate the navigation stack.\n *\n * ### Injecting NavController\n * Injecting NavController will always get you an instance of the nearest\n * NavController, regardless of whether it is a Tab or a Nav.\n *\n * Behind the scenes, when Ionic instantiates a new NavController, it creates an\n * injector with NavController bound to that instance (usually either a Nav or\n * Tab) and adds the injector to its own providers.  For more information on\n * providers and dependency injection, see [Providers and DI]().\n *\n * Instead, you can inject NavController and know that it is the correct\n * navigation controller for most situations (for more advanced situations, see\n * [Menu](../../Menu/Menu/) and [Tab](../../Tab/Tab/)).\n *\n * ```ts\n *  class MyComponent {\n *    constructor(private nav: NavController) {\n *\n *    }\n *  }\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ## Page creation\n * Pages are created when they are added to the navigation stack.  For methods\n * like [push()](#push), the NavController takes any component class that is\n * decorated with `@Component` as its first argument.  The NavController then\n * compiles that component, adds it to the app and animates it into view.\n *\n * By default, pages are cached and left in the DOM if they are navigated away\n * from but still in the navigation stack (the exiting page on a `push()` for\n * example).  They are destroyed when removed from the navigation stack (on\n * [pop()](#pop) or [setRoot()](#setRoot)).\n *\n *\n * ## Lifecycle events\n * Lifecycle events are fired during various stages of navigation.  They can be\n * defined in any component type which is pushed/popped from a `NavController`.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {Component } from '@angular/core';\n *\n * @Component({\n *   template: 'Hello World'\n * })\n * class HelloWorld {\n *   ionViewLoaded() {\n *     console.log(\"I'm alive!\");\n *   }\n *   ionViewWillLeave() {\n *     console.log(\"Looks like I'm about to leave :(\");\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *  | Page Event          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n *  |---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n *  | `ionViewLoaded`     | Runs when the page has loaded.

In most cases the async nature of a\n * transition doesn't cause any problems and the nav controller is pretty good about handling\n * which transition was the most recent when multiple transitions have been kicked off.\n * However, when an app begins firing off many transitions, on the same stack at\n * *roughly* the same time, the nav controller can start to get lost as to which transition\n * should be finishing, and which transitions should not be animated.\n *\n * In cases where an app's navigation can be altered by other async tasks, which may or\n * may not take a long time, it's best to rely on each nav transition's returned\n * promise. So instead of firing and forgetting multiple `push` or `pop` nav transitions,\n * it's better to fire the next nav transition when the previous one has finished.\n *\n * In the example below, after the async operation has completed, we then want to transition\n * to another page. Where the potential problem comes in, is that if the async operation\n * completed 100ms after the first transition started, then kicking off another transition\n * halfway through the first transition ends up with a janky animation. Instead, it's best\n * to always ensure the first transition has already finished before starting the next.\n *\n * ```ts\n * // begin the first transition\n * let navTransition = this.nav.push(SomePage);\n *\n * // start an async call, we're not sure how long it'll take\n * someAsyncOperation().then(() => {\n *   // incase the async operation completed faster than the time\n *   // it took to finish the first transition, this logic should\n *   // always ensure that the previous transition has resolved\n *   // first before kicking off the next transition\n *   navTransition.then(() => {\n *     this.nav.push(AnotherPage);\n *   });\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ## NavOptions\n *\n * Some methods on `NavController` allow for customizing the current transition.\n * To do this, we can pass an object with the modified properites.\n *\n * | Property  | Value     | Description                                                                                                |\n * |-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | animate   | `boolean` | Whether or not the transition should animate.                                                              |\n * | animation | `string`  | What kind of animation should be used.                                                                     |\n * | direction | `string`  | The conceptual direction the user is navigating. For example, is the user navigating `forward`, or `back`? |\n * | duration  | `number`  | The length in milliseconds the animation should take.                                                      |\n * | easing    | `string`  | The easing for the animation.                                                                              |\n *\n * The property 'animation' understands the following values: `md-transition`, `ios-transition` and `wp-transition`.\n *\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#navigation Navigation Component Docs}\n */\nexport var NavController = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NavController, _super);\n    function NavController(parent, _app, config, _keyboard, elementRef, _zone, _renderer, _compiler, _menuCtrl) {\n        _super.call(this, elementRef);\n        this._app = _app;\n        this._keyboard = _keyboard;\n        this._zone = _zone;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._compiler = _compiler;\n        this._menuCtrl = _menuCtrl;\n        this._transIds = 0;\n        this._init = false;\n        this._children = [];\n        this._ids = -1;\n        this._views = [];\n        /**\n         * @private\n         */\n        this.routers = [];\n        /**\n         * @private\n         */\n        this.isPortal = false;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         */\n        this._trnsTime = 0;\n        this.parent = parent;\n        this.config = config;\n        this._trnsDelay = config.get('pageTransitionDelay');\n        this._sbEnabled = config.getBoolean('swipeBackEnabled');\n        this._sbThreshold = config.getNumber('swipeBackThreshold', 40);\n        this.id = (++ctrlIds).toString();\n        this.viewDidLoad = new EventEmitter();\n        this.viewWillEnter = new EventEmitter();\n        this.viewDidEnter = new EventEmitter();\n        this.viewWillLeave = new EventEmitter();\n        this.viewDidLeave = new EventEmitter();\n        this.viewWillUnload = new EventEmitter();\n        this.viewDidUnload = new EventEmitter();\n    }\n    /**\n     * @private\n     */\n    NavController.prototype.setViewport = function (val) {\n        this._viewport = val;\n    };\n    /**\n     * Set the root for the current navigation stack.\n     * @param {Page} page  The name of the component you want to push on the navigation stack.\n     * @param {object} [params={}] Any nav-params you want to pass along to the next view.\n     * @param {object} [opts={}] Any options you want to use pass to transtion.\n     * @returns {Promise} Returns a promise which is resolved when the transition has completed.\n     */\n    NavController.prototype.setRoot = function (page, params, opts) {\n        return this.setPages([{ page: page, params: params }], opts);\n    };\n    /**\n     * Set the views of the current navigation stack and navigate to the\n     * last view.

See the [Menu](../Menu) API docs\n * for more information on adding menu components.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu [content]=\"mycontent\">\n *   <ion-content>\n *     <ion-list>\n *     ...\n *     </ion-list>\n *   </ion-content>\n * </ion-menu>\n *\n * <ion-nav #mycontent [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>\n * ```\n *\n * To call the controller methods, inject the `MenuController` provider\n * into the page. Then, create some methods for opening, closing, and\n * toggling the menu.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {Component} from '@angular/core';\n * import {MenuController} from 'ionic-angular';\n *\n * @Component({...})\n * export class MyPage {\n *\n *  constructor(private menu: MenuController) {\n *\n *  }\n *\n *  openMenu() {\n *    this.menu.open();\n *  }\n *\n *  closeMenu() {\n *    this.menu.close();\n *  }\n *\n *  toggleMenu() {\n *    this.menu.toggle();\n *  }\n *\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Since only one menu exists, the `MenuController` will grab the\n * correct menu and call the correct method for each.\n *\n *\n * ### Multiple Menus on Different Sides\n *\n * For applications with both a left and right menu, the desired menu can be\n * grabbed by passing the `side` of the menu. If nothing is passed, it will\n * default to the `\"left\"` menu.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu side=\"left\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * <ion-menu side=\"right\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * <ion-nav #mycontent [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n *  toggleLeftMenu() {\n *    this.menu.toggle();\n *  }\n *\n *  toggleRightMenu() {\n *    this.menu.toggle('right');\n *  }\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Multiple Menus on the Same Side\n *\n * An application can have multiple menus on the same side. In order to determine\n * the menu to control, an `id` should be passed. In the example below, the menu\n * with the `authenticated` id will be enabled, and the menu with the `unauthenticated`\n * id will be disabled.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu id=\"authenticated\" side=\"left\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * <ion-menu id=\"unauthenticated\" side=\"left\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * <ion-nav #mycontent [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n *  enableAuthenticatedMenu() {\n *    this.menu.enable(true, 'authenticated');\n *    this.menu.enable(false, 'unauthenticated');\n *  }\n * ```\n *\n * Note: if an app only has one menu, there is no reason to pass an `id`.\n *\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/menu/\n *\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#menus Menu Component Docs}\n * @see {@link ../Menu Menu API Docs}\n *\n */\nexport var MenuController = (function () {\n    function MenuController() {\n        this._menus = [];\n    }\n    /**\n     * Progamatically open the Menu.\n     * @return {Promise} returns a promise when the menu is fully opened\n     */\n    MenuController.prototype.open = function (menuId) {\n        var menu = this.get(menuId);\n        if (menu) {\n            return menu.open();\n        }\n        return Promise.resolve(false);\n    };\n    /**\n     * Progamatically close the Menu.

When placed within\n * `<ion-content>`, toolbars will scroll with the content.\n *\n *\n * ### Buttons in a Toolbar\n * Buttons placed in a toolbar should be placed inside of the `<ion-buttons>`\n * element. An exception to this is a [menuToggle](../../menu/MenuToggle) button.\n * It should not be placed inside of the `<ion-buttons>` element. Both the\n * `<ion-buttons>` element and the `menuToggle` can be positioned inside of the\n * toolbar using different properties. The below chart has a description of each\n * property.\n *\n * | Property    | Description                                                                                                           |\n * |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | `start`     | Positions element to the left of the content in `ios` mode, and directly to the right in `md` and `wp` mode.    |\n * | `end`       | Positions element to the right of the content in `ios` mode, and to the far right in `md` and `wp` mode.        |\n * | `left`      | Positions element to the left of all other elements.                                                            |\n * | `right`     | Positions element to the right of all other elements.                                                           |\n *\n *\n * ### Multiple Toolbars\n * Toolbars can be stacked up vertically in `<ion-header>`, `<ion-content>`, and\n * `<ion-footer>` elements. However, toolbars also come with borders on both\n * the top and bottom of the toolbar. To give developers full control of the\n * design, Ionic also includes the `no-border-bottom` and `no-border-top` attributes.\n * For example, sometimes two vertically stacked toolbars may have different\n * background colors, in this case it might be best to leave a border between them.\n * However, if they have the same background color, the app may look best without\n * a border between them. The main point here is, it's entirely up to the app's design\n * to decide when and when not to show borders between toolbars, and to do so then\n * each toolbar can individually set `no-border-bottom` and `no-border-top` attributes.\n *\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n * <ion-header>\n *\n *   <ion-toolbar no-border-bottom>\n *     <ion-buttons start>\n *       <button>\n *         <ion-icon name=\"contact\"></ion-icon>\n *       </button>\n *       <button>\n *         <ion-icon name=\"search\"></ion-icon>\n *       </button>\n *     </ion-buttons>\n *     <ion-title>My Toolbar Title</ion-title>\n *   </ion-toolbar>\n *\n *   <ion-toolbar no-border-top>\n *     <ion-title>I'm a subheader</ion-title>\n *   </ion-toolbar>\n *\n * <ion-header>\n *\n *\n * <ion-content>\n *\n *   <ion-toolbar>\n *     <ion-title>Scrolls with the content</ion-title>\n *   </ion-toolbar>\n *\n * </ion-content>\n *\n *\n * <ion-footer>\n *\n *   <ion-toolbar no-border-bottom>\n *     <ion-title>I'm a subfooter</ion-title>\n *     <ion-buttons right>\n *       <button>\n *         <ion-icon name=\"menu\"></ion-icon>\n *       </button>\n *     </ion-buttons>\n *   </ion-toolbar>\n *\n *   <ion-toolbar no-border-top>\n *     <ion-title>I'm a footer</ion-title>\n *     <ion-buttons end>\n *       <button>\n *         <ion-icon name=\"more\"></ion-icon>\n *       </button>\n *       <button>\n *         <ion-icon name=\"options\"></ion-icon>\n *       </button>\n *     </ion-buttons>\n *   </ion-toolbar>\n *\n * </ion-footer>\n *  ```\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/toolbar/\n * @see {@link ../../navbar/Navbar/ Navbar API Docs}\n */\nexport var Toolbar = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(Toolbar, _super);\n    function Toolbar(viewCtrl, header, footer, config, elementRef) {\n        _super.call(this, elementRef);\n        if (viewCtrl && (header || footer)) {\n            // only toolbars within headers and footer are view toolbars\n            // toolbars within the content are not view toolbars, since they\n            // are apart of the content, and could be anywhere within the content\n            viewCtrl.setToolbarRef(elementRef);\n        }\n        this._sbPadding = config.getBoolean('statusbarPadding');\n    }\n    Toolbar = __decorate([\n        Component({\n            selector: 'ion-toolbar',\n            template: \"\\n    <div class=\\\"toolbar-background\\\"></div>\\n    <ng-content select=\\\"[menuToggle],ion-buttons[left]\\\"></ng-content>\\n    <ng-content select=\\\"ion-buttons[start]\\\"></ng-content>\\n    <ng-content select=\\\"ion-buttons[end],ion-buttons[right]\\\"></ng-content>\\n    <div class=\\\"toolbar-content\\\">\\n      <ng-content></ng-content>\\n    </div>\\n  \",\n            host: {\n                'class': 'toolbar',\n                '[class.statusbar-padding]': '_sbPadding'\n            },\n            changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,\n        }),\n        __param(0, Optional()),\n        __param(1, Optional()),\n        __param(2, Optional()), \n        __metadata('design:paramtypes', [(typeof (_a = typeof ViewController !== 'undefined' && ViewController) === 'function' && _a) || Object, Header, Footer, (typeof (_b = typeof Config !== 'undefined' && Config) === 'function' && _b) || Object, (typeof (_c = typeof ElementRef !== 'undefined' && ElementRef) === 'function' && _c) || Object])\n    ], Toolbar);\n    return Toolbar;\n    var _a, _b, _c;\n}(ToolbarBase));\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./~/ionic-angular/components/toolbar/toolbar.js","/**\n * @private\n */\nexport var PointerEvents = (function () {\n    function PointerEvents(ele, pointerDown, pointerMove, pointerUp, zone, option) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.ele = ele;\n        this.pointerDown = pointerDown;\n        this.pointerMove = pointerMove;\n        this.pointerUp = pointerUp;\n        this.zone = zone;\n        this.option = option;\n        this.rmTouchStart = null;\n        this.rmTouchMove = null;\n        this.rmTouchEnd = null;\n        this.rmMouseStart = null;\n        this.rmMouseMove = null;\n        this.rmMouseUp = null;\n        this.lastTouchEvent = 0;\n        this.mouseWait = 2 * 1000;\n        this.rmTouchStart = listenEvent(ele, 'touchstart', zone, option, function (ev) { return _this.handleTouchStart(ev);

If an item\n * should not be reordered, it shouldn't be included in this group. For\n * example, the following code works because the items are grouped in the\n * `<ion-list>`:\n *\n *  ```html\n *  <ion-list reorder=\"true\">\n *    <ion-item *ngFor=\"let item of items\">{% raw %}{{ item }}{% endraw %}</ion-item>\n *  </ion-list>\n *  ```\n *\n * However, the below list includes a header that shouldn't be reordered:\n *\n *  ```html\n *  <ion-list reorder=\"true\">\n *    <ion-list-header>Header</ion-list-header>\n *    <ion-item *ngFor=\"let item of items\">{% raw %}{{ item }}{% endraw %}</ion-item>\n *  </ion-list>\n *  ```\n *\n * In order to mix different sets of items, `ion-item-group` should be used to\n * group the reorderable items:\n *\n *  ```html\n *  <ion-list>\n *    <ion-list-header>Header</ion-list-header>\n *    <ion-item-group reorder=\"true\">\n *      <ion-item *ngFor=\"let item of items\">{% raw %}{{ item }}{% endraw %}</ion-item>\n *    </ion-item-group>\n *  </ion-list>\n *  ```\n *\n * It's important to note that in this example, the `[reorder]` directive is applied to\n * the `<ion-item-group>` instead of the `<ion-list>`. This way makes it possible to\n * mix items that should and shouldn't be reordered.\n *\n *\n * ## Implementing the Reorder Function\n *\n * When the item is dragged and dropped into the new position, the `(ionItemReorder)` event is\n * emitted. This event provides the initial index (from) and the new index (to) of the reordered\n * item. For example, if the first item is dragged to the fifth position, the event will emit\n * `{from: 0, to: 4}`. Note that the index starts at zero.\n *\n * A function should be called when the event is emitted that handles the reordering of the items.\n * See [usage](#usage) below for some examples.\n *\n *\n * @usage\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-list>\n *   <ion-list-header>Header</ion-list-header>\n *   <ion-item-group reorder=\"true\" (ionItemReorder)=\"reorderItems($event)\">\n *     <ion-item *ngFor=\"let item of items\">{% raw %}{{ item }}{% endraw %}</ion-item>\n *   </ion-item-group>\n * </ion-list>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * class MyComponent {\n *   items = [];\n *\n *   constructor() {\n *     for (let x = 0; x < 5; x++) {\n *       this.items.push(x);\n *     }\n *   }\n *\n *   reorderItems(indexes) {\n *     let element = this.items[indexes.from];\n *     this.items.splice(indexes.from, 1);\n *     this.items.splice(indexes.to, 0, element);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Ionic also provides a helper function called `reorderArray` to\n * reorder the array of items.

By default, the tabs are placed at the bottom of the screen\n * for `ios` mode, and at the top for the `md` and `wp` modes. You can\n * configure the position using the `tabbarPlacement` property on the\n * `<ion-tabs>` element, or in your app's [config](../../config/Config/).\n * See the [Input Properties](#input-properties) below for the available\n * values of `tabbarPlacement`.\n *\n * ### Layout\n *\n * The layout for all of the tabs can be defined using the `tabbarLayout`\n * property. If the individual tab has a title and icon, the icons will\n * show on top of the title by default. All tabs can be changed by setting\n * the value of `tabbarLayout` on the `<ion-tabs>` element, or in your\n * app's [config](../../config/Config/). For example, this is useful if\n * you want to show tabs with a title only on Android, but show icons\n * and a title for iOS. See the [Input Properties](#input-properties)\n * below for the available values of `tabbarLayout`.\n *\n * ### Selecting a Tab\n *\n * There are different ways you can select a specific tab from the tabs\n * component. You can use the `selectedIndex` property to set the index\n * on the `<ion-tabs>` element, or you can call `select()` from the `Tabs`\n * instance after creation. See [usage](#usage) below for more information.\n *\n * @usage\n *\n * You can add a basic tabs template to a `@Component` using the following\n * template:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-tabs>\n *   <ion-tab [root]=\"tab1Root\"></ion-tab>\n *   <ion-tab [root]=\"tab2Root\"></ion-tab>\n *   <ion-tab [root]=\"tab3Root\"></ion-tab>\n * </ion-tabs>\n * ```\n *\n * Where `tab1Root`, `tab2Root`, and `tab3Root` are each a page:\n *\n *```ts\n * @Component({\n *   templateUrl: 'build/pages/tabs/tabs.html'\n * })\n * export class TabsPage {\n *   // this tells the tabs component which Pages\n *   // should be each tab's root Page\n *   tab1Root = Page1;\n *   tab2Root = Page2;\n *   tab3Root = Page3;\n *\n *   constructor() {\n *\n *   }\n * }\n *```\n *\n * By default, the first tab will be selected upon navigation to the\n * Tabs page. We can change the selected tab by using `selectedIndex`\n * on the `<ion-tabs>` element:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-tabs selectedIndex=\"2\">\n *   <ion-tab [root]=\"tab1Root\"></ion-tab>\n *   <ion-tab [root]=\"tab2Root\"></ion-tab>\n *   <ion-tab [root]=\"tab3Root\"></ion-tab>\n * </ion-tabs>\n * ```\n *\n * Since the index starts at `0`, this will select the 3rd tab which has\n * root set to `tab3Root`. If you wanted to change it dynamically from\n * your class, you could use [property binding](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html#!#property-binding).\n *\n * Alternatively, you can grab the `Tabs` instance and call the `select()`\n * method. This requires the `<ion-tabs>` element to have an `id`. For\n * example, set the value of `id` to `myTabs`:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-tabs #myTabs>\n *   <ion-tab [root]=\"tab1Root\"></ion-tab>\n *   <ion-tab [root]=\"tab2Root\"></ion-tab>\n *   <ion-tab [root]=\"tab3Root\"></ion-tab>\n * </ion-tabs>\n * ```\n *\n * Then in your class you can grab the `Tabs` instance and call `select()`,\n * passing the index of the tab as the argument. Here we're grabbing the tabs\n * by using ViewChild.\n *\n *```ts\n * export class TabsPage {\n *\n * @ViewChild('myTabs') tabRef: Tabs;\n *\n * ionViewDidEnter() {\n *   this.tabRef.select(2);\n *  }\n *\n * }\n *```\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/tabs/\n *\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#tabs Tabs Component Docs}\n * @see {@link ../Tab Tab API Docs}\n * @see {@link ../../config/Config Config API Docs}\n *\n */\nexport var Tabs = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(Tabs, _super);\n    function Tabs(parent, viewCtrl, _app, _config, _elementRef, _platform, _renderer) {\n        var _this = this;\n        _super.call(this, _elementRef);\n        this._app = _app;\n        this._config = _config;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._platform = _platform;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._ids = -1;\n        this._tabs = [];\n        this._onReady = null;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         */\n        this.selectHistory = [];\n        /**\n         * @input {any} Expression to evaluate when the tab changes.\n         */\n        this.ionChange = new EventEmitter();\n        this.parent = parent;\n        this.id = ++tabIds;\n        this.subPages = _config.getBoolean('tabSubPages');\n        this._useHighlight = _config.getBoolean('tabbarHighlight');\n        this._sbPadding = _config.getBoolean('statusbarPadding');\n        if (parent) {\n            // this Tabs has a parent Nav\n            parent.registerChildNav(this);\n        }\n        else if (this._app) {\n            // this is the root navcontroller for the entire app\n            this._app.setRootNav(this);\n        }\n        // Tabs may also be an actual ViewController which was navigated to\n        // if Tabs is static and not navigated to within a NavController\n        // then skip this and don't treat it as it's own ViewController\n        if (viewCtrl) {\n            viewCtrl.setContent(this);\n            viewCtrl.setContentRef(_elementRef);\n            viewCtrl.loaded = function (done) {\n                _this._onReady = done;\n            };\n        }\n    }\n    /**\n     * @private\n     */\n    Tabs.prototype.ngAfterViewInit = function () {\n        var _this = this;\n        this._setConfig('tabbarPlacement', 'bottom');\n        this._setConfig('tabbarLayout', 'icon-top');\n        if (this._useHighlight) {\n            this._platform.onResize(function () {\n                _this._highlight.select(_this.getSelected());\n            });\n        }\n        var preloadTabs = (isBlank(this.preloadTabs) ?

It appears on top of the app's content, and must be manually\n * dismissed by the user before they can resume interaction with the app.\n * Dangerous (destructive) options are made obvious in `ios` mode. There are easy\n * ways to cancel out of the action sheet, such as tapping the backdrop or\n * hitting the escape key on desktop.\n *\n * An action sheet is created from an array of `buttons`, with each button\n * including properties for its `text`, and optionally a `handler` and `role`.\n * If a handler returns `false` then the action sheet will not be dismissed. An\n * action sheet can also optionally have a `title`, `subTitle` and an `icon`.\n *\n * A button's `role` property can either be `destructive` or `cancel`. Buttons\n * without a role property will have the default look for the platform. Buttons\n * with the `cancel` role will always load as the bottom button, no matter where\n * they are in the array. All other buttons will be displayed in the order they\n * have been added to the `buttons` array. Note: We recommend that `destructive`\n * buttons are always the first button in the array, making them the top button.\n * Additionally, if the action sheet is dismissed by tapping the backdrop, then\n * it will fire the handler from the button with the cancel role.\n *\n * You can pass all of the action sheet's options in the first argument of\n * the create method: `ActionSheet.create(opts)`. Otherwise the action sheet's\n * instance has methods to add options, like `setTitle()` or `addButton()`.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```ts\n * import {ActionSheetController} from 'ionic-angular'\n *\n * export class MyClass{\n *\n *  constructor(private actionSheetCtrl: ActionSheetController) {}\n *\n *  presentActionSheet() {\n *    let actionSheet = this.actionSheetCtrl.create({\n *      title: 'Modify your album',\n *      buttons: [\n *        {\n *          text: 'Destructive',\n *          role: 'destructive',\n *          handler: () => {\n *            console.log('Destructive clicked');\n *          }\n *        },\n *        {\n *          text: 'Archive',\n *          handler: () => {\n *            console.log('Archive clicked');\n *          }\n *        },\n *        {\n *          text: 'Cancel',\n *          role: 'cancel',\n *          handler: () => {\n *            console.log('Cancel clicked');\n *          }\n *        }\n *      ]\n *    });\n *\n *    actionSheet.present();\n *  }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @advanced\n *\n * ActionSheet create options\n *\n * | Option                | Type       | Description                                                     |\n * |-----------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | title                 |`string`    | The title for the actionsheet                                   |\n * | subTitle              |`string`    | The sub-title for the actionsheet                               |\n * | cssClass              |`string`    | An additional class for custom styles                           |\n * | enableBackdropDismiss |`boolean`   | If the actionsheet should close when the user taps the backdrop |\n * | buttons               |`array<any>`| An array of buttons to display                                  |\n *\n * ActionSheet button options\n *\n * | Option   | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                      |\n * |----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | text     | `string` | The buttons text                                                                                                                                 |\n * | icon     | `icon`   | The buttons icons                                                                                                                                |\n * | handler  | `any`    | An express the button should evaluate                                                                                                            |\n * | cssClass | `string` | An additional class for custom styles                                                                                                            |\n * | role     | `string` | How the button should be displayed, `destructive` or `cancel`.

However, because multiple\n * transitions were fired at roughly the same time, it's difficult for the\n * nav controller to cleanly animate multiple transitions that may\n * have been kicked off asynchronously. This is further described in the\n * [`Nav Transition Promises`](../../nav/NavController/#nav-transition-promises) section. For action sheets,\n * this means it's best to wait for the action sheet to finish its transition\n * out before starting a new transition on the same nav controller.\n *\n * In the example below, after the button has been clicked, its handler\n * waits on async operation to complete, *then* it uses `pop` to navigate\n * back a page in the same stack. The potential problem is that the async operation\n * may have been completed before the action sheet has even finished its transition\n * out. In this case, it's best to ensure the action sheet has finished its transition\n * out first, *then* start the next transition.\n *\n * ```ts\n * let actionSheet = this.actionSheetCtrl.create({\n *   title: 'Hello',\n *   buttons: [{\n *     text: 'Ok',\n *     handler: () => {\n *       // user has clicked the action sheet button\n *       // begin the action sheet's dimiss transition\n *       let navTransition = actionSheet.dismiss();\n *\n *       // start some async method\n *       someAsyncOperation().then(() => {\n *         // once the async operation has completed\n *         // then run the next nav transition after the\n *         // first transition has finished animating out\n *\n *         navTransition.then(() => {\n *           this.nav.pop();\n *         });\n *       });\n *       return false;\n *     }\n *   }]\n * });\n *\n * actionSheet.present();\n * ```\n *\n * It's important to note that the handler returns `false`. A feature of\n * button handlers is that they automatically dismiss the action sheet when their button\n * was clicked, however, we'll need more control regarding the transition. Because\n * the handler returns `false`, then the action sheet does not automatically dismiss\n * itself. Instead, you now have complete control of when the action sheet has finished\n * transitioning, and the ability to wait for the action sheet to finish transitioning\n * out before starting a new transition.\n *\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/action-sheet/\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#action-sheets ActionSheet Component Docs}\n */\nexport var ActionSheetController = (function () {\n    function ActionSheetController(_app) {\n        this._app = _app;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Open an action sheet with a title, subTitle, and an array of buttons\n     * @param {ActionSheetOptions} opts Action sheet options\n     */\n    ActionSheetController.prototype.create = function (opts) {\n        if (opts === void 0) { opts = {}; }\n        return new ActionSheet(this._app, opts);\n    };\n    ActionSheetController = __decorate([\n        Injectable(), \n        __metadata('design:paramtypes', [(typeof (_a = typeof App !== 'undefined' && App) === 'function' && _a) || Object])\n    ], ActionSheetController);\n    return ActionSheetController;\n    var _a;\n}());\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./~/ionic-angular/components/action-sheet/action-sheet.js","var __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?

An alert appears on top\n * of the app's content, and must be manually dismissed by the user before\n * they can resume interaction with the app. It can also optionally have a\n * `title`, `subTitle` and `message`.\n *\n * You can pass all of the alert's options in the first argument of\n * the create method: `create(opts)`. Otherwise the alert's instance\n * has methods to add options, such as `setTitle()` or `addButton()`.\n *\n *\n * ### Alert Buttons\n *\n * In the array of `buttons`, each button includes properties for its `text`,\n * and optionally a `handler`. If a handler returns `false` then the alert\n * will not automatically be dismissed when the button is clicked. All\n * buttons will show  up in the order they have been added to the `buttons`\n * array, from left to right. Note: The right most button (the last one in\n * the array) is the main button.\n *\n * Optionally, a `role` property can be added to a button, such as `cancel`.\n * If a `cancel` role is on one of the buttons, then if the alert is\n * dismissed by tapping the backdrop, then it will fire the handler from\n * the button with a cancel role.\n *\n *\n * ### Alert Inputs\n *\n * Alerts can also include several different inputs whose data can be passed\n * back to the app. Inputs can be used as a simple way to prompt users for\n * information. Radios, checkboxes and text inputs are all accepted, but they\n * cannot be mixed.

However, because multiple\n * transitions were fired at roughly the same time, it's difficult for the\n * nav controller to cleanly animate multiple transitions that may\n * have been kicked off asynchronously. This is further described in the\n * [`Nav Transition Promises`](../../nav/NavController) section. For alerts,\n * this means it's best to wait for the alert to finish its transition\n * out before starting a new transition on the same nav controller.\n *\n * In the example below, after the alert button has been clicked, its handler\n * waits on async operation to complete, *then* it uses `pop` to navigate\n * back a page in the same stack. The potential problem is that the async operation\n * may have been completed before the alert has even finished its transition\n * out. In this case, it's best to ensure the alert has finished its transition\n * out first, *then* start the next transition.\n *\n * ```ts\n * let alert = this.alertCtrl.create({\n *   title: 'Hello',\n *   buttons: [{\n *     text: 'Ok',\n *     handler: () => {\n *       // user has clicked the alert button\n *       // begin the alert's dismiss transition\n *       let navTransition = alert.dismiss();\n *\n *       // start some async method\n *       someAsyncOperation().then(() => {\n *         // once the async operation has completed\n *         // then run the next nav transition after the\n *         // first transition has finished animating out\n *\n *         navTransition.then(() => {\n *           this.nav.pop();\n *         });\n *       });\n *       return false;\n *     }\n *   }]\n * });\n *\n * alert.present();\n * ```\n *\n * It's important to note that the handler returns `false`. A feature of\n * button handlers is that they automatically dismiss the alert when their button\n * was clicked, however, we'll need more control regarding the transition. Because\n * the handler returns `false`, then the alert does not automatically dismiss\n * itself. Instead, you now have complete control of when the alert has finished\n * transitioning, and the ability to wait for the alert to finish transitioning\n * out before starting a new transition.\n *\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/alert/\n */\nexport var AlertController = (function () {\n    function AlertController(_app) {\n        this._app = _app;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Display an alert with a title, inputs, and buttons\n     * @param {AlertOptions} opts Alert.

The\n * `refresh` output event is fired when the user has pulled down far\n * enough to kick off the refreshing process. Once the async operation\n * has completed and the refreshing should end, call `complete()`.\n *\n * Note: Do not wrap the `ion-refresher` in a `*ngIf`. It will not render\n * properly this way. Please use the `enabled` property instead to\n * display or hide the refresher.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n * <ion-content>\n *\n *   <ion-refresher (ionRefresh)=\"doRefresh($event)\">\n *     <ion-refresher-content></ion-refresher-content>\n *   </ion-refresher>\n *\n * </ion-content>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * @Component({...})\n * export class NewsFeedPage {\n *\n *   doRefresh(refresher) {\n *     console.log('Begin async operation', refresher);\n *\n *     setTimeout(() => {\n *       console.log('Async operation has ended');\n *       refresher.complete();\n *     }, 2000);\n *   }\n *\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ## Refresher Content\n *\n * By default, Ionic provides the pulling icon and refreshing spinner that\n * looks best for the platform the user is on. However, you can change the\n * default icon and spinner, along with adding text for each state by\n * adding properties to the child `ion-refresher-content` component.\n *\n *  ```html\n *  <ion-content>\n *\n *    <ion-refresher (ionRefresh)=\"doRefresh($event)\">\n *      <ion-refresher-content\n *        pullingIcon=\"arrow-dropdown\"\n *        pullingText=\"Pull to refresh\"\n *        refreshingSpinner=\"circles\"\n *        refreshingText=\"Refreshing...\">\n *      </ion-refresher-content>\n *    </ion-refresher>\n *\n *  </ion-content>\n *  ```\n *\n *\n * ## Further Customizing Refresher Content\n *\n * The `ion-refresher` component holds the refresh logic.\n * It requires a child component in order to display the content.\n * Ionic uses `ion-refresher-content` by default. This component\n * displays the refresher and changes the look depending\n * on the refresher's state. Separating these components\n * allows developers to create their own refresher content\n * components. You could replace our default content with\n * custom SVG or CSS animations.\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/refresher/\n *\n */\nexport var Refresher = (function () {\n    function Refresher(_content, _zone) {\n        this._content = _content;\n        this._zone = _zone;\n        this._appliedStyles = false;\n        this._lastCheck = 0;\n        this._isEnabled = true;\n        this._events = new UIEventManager(false);\n        this._top = '';\n        /**\n         * The current state which the refresher is in.

For more information on using\n * navigation controllers take a look at the [NavController API Docs](../../nav/NavController/).\n *\n * See the [Tabs API Docs](../Tabs/) for more details on configuring Tabs.\n *\n * @usage\n *\n * To add a basic tab, you can use the following markup where the `root` property\n * is the page you want to load for that tab, `tabTitle` is the optional text to\n * display on the tab, and `tabIcon` is the optional [icon](../../icon/Icon/).\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-tabs>\n *  <ion-tab [root]=\"chatRoot\" tabTitle=\"Chat\" tabIcon=\"chat\"><ion-tab>\n * </ion-tabs>\n * ```\n *\n * Then, in your class you can set `chatRoot` to an imported class:\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {ChatPage} from '../chat/chat';\n *\n * export class Tabs {\n *   // here we'll set the property of chatRoot to\n *   // the imported class of ChatPage\n *   chatRoot = ChatPage;\n *\n *   constructor() {\n *\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * You can also pass some parameters to the root page of the tab through\n * `rootParams`. Below we pass `chatParams` to the Chat tab:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-tabs>\n *  <ion-tab [root]=\"chatRoot\" [rootParams]=\"chatParams\" tabTitle=\"Chat\" tabIcon=\"chat\"><ion-tab>\n * </ion-tabs>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * export class Tabs {\n *   chatRoot = ChatPage;\n *\n *   // set some user information on chatParams\n *   chatParams = {\n *     user1: \"admin\",\n *     user2: \"ionic\"\n *   };\n *\n *   constructor() {\n *\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * And in `ChatPage` you can get the data from `NavParams`:\n *\n * ```ts\n * export class ChatPage {\n *   constructor(navParams: NavParams) {\n *     console.log(\"Passed params\", navParams.data);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Sometimes you may want to call a method instead of navigating to a new\n * page. You can use the `(ionSelect)` event to call a method on your class when\n * the tab is selected. Below is an example of presenting a modal from one of\n * the tabs.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-tabs preloadTabs=\"false\">\n *   <ion-tab (ionSelect)=\"chat()\"></ion-tab>\n * </ion-tabs>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * export class Tabs {\n *   constructor(private modalCtrl: ModalController) {\n *\n *   }\n *\n *   chat() {\n *     let modal = this.modalCtrl.create(ChatPage);\n *     modal.present();\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/tabs/\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#tabs Tabs Component Docs}\n * @see {@link ../../tabs/Tabs Tabs API Docs}\n * @see {@link ../../nav/Nav Nav API Docs}\n * @see {@link ../../nav/NavController NavController API Docs}\n */\nexport var Tab = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(Tab, _super);\n    function Tab(parent, app, config, keyboard, elementRef, zone, renderer, compiler, _cd, menuCtrl) {\n        // A Tab is a NavController for its child pages\n        _super.call(this, parent, app, config, keyboard, elementRef, zone, renderer, compiler, menuCtrl);\n        this.parent = parent;\n        this._cd = _cd;\n        this._isEnabled = true;\n        this._isShown = true;\n        /**\n         * @output {Tab} Method to call when the current tab is selected\n         */\n        this.ionSelect = new EventEmitter();\n        parent.add(this);\n        if (parent.rootNav) {\n            this._sbEnabled = parent.rootNav.isSwipeBackEnabled();\n        }\n        this._panelId = 'tabpanel-' + this.id;\n        this._btnId = 'tab-' + this.id;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(Tab.prototype, \"enabled\", {\n        /**\n         * @input {boolean} If the tab is enabled or not.

Every element in the list\n * has identical properties.\n *\n * An `element` may inherit additional properties from `parentElement` If no `^parentElement` is\n * specified then `\"\"` (blank) element is assumed.\n *\n * NOTE: The blank element inherits from root `*` element, the super element of all elements.\n *\n * NOTE an element prefix such as `:svg:` has no special meaning to the schema.\n *\n * ## Properties\n *\n * Each element has a set of properties separated by `,` (commas). Each property can be prefixed\n * by a special character designating its type:\n *\n * - (no prefix): property is a string.\n * - `*`: property represents an event.\n * - `!`: property is a boolean.\n * - `#`: property is a number.\n * - `%`: property is an object.\n *\n * ## Query\n *\n * The class creates an internal squas representaino which allows to easily answer the query of\n * if a given property exist on a given element.\n *\n * NOTE: We don't yet support querying for types or events.\n * NOTE: This schema is auto extracted from `schema_extractor.ts` located in the test folder,\n *       see dom_element_schema_registry_spec.ts\n */\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n// =========== S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P  ===========\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n//\n//                       DO NOT EDIT THIS DOM SCHEMA WITHOUT A SECURITY REVIEW!\n//\n// Newly added properties must be security reviewed and assigned an appropriate SecurityContext in\n// dom_security_schema.ts.

The DateTime component is similar to the native\n * `<input type=\"datetime-local\">` element, however, Ionic's DateTime component makes\n * it easy to display the date and time in a preferred format, and manage the datetime\n * values.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Date</ion-label>\n *   <ion-datetime displayFormat=\"MM/DD/YYYY\" [(ngModel)]=\"myDate\"></ion-datetime>\n * </ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ## Display and Picker Formats\n *\n * The DateTime component displays the values in two places: in the `<ion-datetime>`\n * component, and in the interface that is presented from the bottom of the screen.\n * The following chart lists all of the formats that can be used.\n *\n * | Format  | Description                    | Example                 |\n * |---------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|\n * | `YYYY`  | Year, 4 digits                 | `2018`                  |\n * | `YY`    | Year, 2 digits                 | `18`                    |\n * | `M`     | Month                          | `1` ... `12`            |\n * | `MM`    | Month, leading zero            | `01` ... `12`           |\n * | `MMM`   | Month, short name              | `Jan`                   |\n * | `MMMM`  | Month, full name               | `January`               |\n * | `D`     | Day                            | `1` ... `31`            |\n * | `DD`    | Day, leading zero              | `01` ... `31`           |\n * | `DDD`   | Day, short name                | `Fri`                   |\n * | `DDDD`  | Day, full name                 | `Friday`                |\n * | `H`     | Hour, 24-hour                  | `0` ... `23`            |\n * | `HH`    | Hour, 24-hour, leading zero    | `00` ... `23`           |\n * | `h`     | Hour, 12-hour                  | `1` ... `12`            |\n * | `hh`    | Hour, 12-hour, leading zero    | `01` ... `12`           |\n * | `a`     | 12-hour time period, lowercase | `am` `pm`               |\n * | `A`     | 12-hour time period, uppercase | `AM` `PM`               |\n * | `m`     | Minute                         | `1` ... `59`            |\n * | `mm`    | Minute, leading zero           | `01` ... `59`           |\n * | `s`     | Second                         | `1` ... `59`            |\n * | `ss`    | Second, leading zero           | `01` ... `59`           |\n * | `Z`     | UTC Timezone Offset            | `Z or +HH:mm or -HH:mm` |\n *\n * **Important**: See the [Month Names and Day of the Week Names](#month-names-and-day-of-the-week-names)\n * section below on how to use different names for the month and day.\n *\n * ### Display Format\n *\n * The `displayFormat` input property specifies how a datetime's value should be\n * printed, as formatted text, within the `ion-datetime` component.\n *\n * In the following example, the display in the `<ion-datetime>` will use the\n * month's short name, the numerical day with a leading zero, a comma and the\n * four-digit year. In addition to the date, it will display the time with the hours\n * in the 24-hour format and the minutes. Any character can be used as a separator.\n * An example display using this format is: `Jun 17, 2005 11:06`.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Date</ion-label>\n *   <ion-datetime displayFormat=\"MMM DD, YYYY HH:mm\" [(ngModel)]=\"myDate\"></ion-datetime>\n * </ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Picker Format\n *\n * The `pickerFormat` input property determines which columns should be shown in the\n * interface, the order of the columns, and which format to use within each column.\n * If the `pickerFormat` input is not provided then it will default to the `displayFormat`.\n *\n * In the following example, the display in the `<ion-datetime>` will use the\n * `MM/YYYY` format, such as `06/2020`. However, the picker interface\n * will display two columns with the month's long name, and the four-digit year.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Date</ion-label>\n *   <ion-datetime displayFormat=\"MM/YYYY\" pickerFormat=\"MMMM YYYY\" [(ngModel)]=\"myDate\"></ion-datetime>\n * </ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Datetime Data\n *\n * Historically, handling datetime values within JavaScript, or even within HTML\n * inputs, has always been a challenge. Specifically, JavaScript's `Date` object is\n * notoriously difficult to correctly parse apart datetime strings or to format\n * datetime values. Even worse is how different browsers and JavaScript versions\n * parse various datetime strings differently, especially per locale.\n *\n * But no worries, all is not lost! Ionic's datetime input has been designed so\n * developers can avoid the common pitfalls, allowing developers to easily format\n * datetime values within the input, and give the user a simple datetime picker for a\n * great user experience.\n *\n * ##### ISO 8601 Datetime Format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ\n *\n * Ionic uses the [ISO 8601 datetime format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)\n * for its value. The value is simply a string, rather than using JavaScript's `Date`\n * object. Additionally, when using the ISO datetime format, it makes it easier\n * to serialize and pass within JSON objects, and sending databases a standardized\n * format which it can be easily parsed if need be.\n *\n * An ISO format can be used as a simple year, or just the hour and minute, or get more\n * detailed down to the millisecond and timezone. Any of the ISO formats below can be used,\n * and after a user selects a new value, Ionic will continue to use the same ISO format\n * which datetime value was originally given as.\n *\n * | Description          | Format                 | Datetime Value Example       |\n * |----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n * | Year                 | YYYY                   | 1994                         |\n * | Year and Month       | YYYY-MM                | 1994-12                      |\n * | Complete Date        | YYYY-MM-DD             | 1994-12-15                   |\n * | Date and Time        | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm       | 1994-12-15T13:47             |\n * | UTC Timezone         | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssTZD | 1994-12-15T13:47:20.789Z     |\n * | Timezone Offset      | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssTZD | 1994-12-15T13:47:20.789+5:00 |\n * | Hour and Minute      | HH:mm                  | 13:47                        |\n * | Hour, Minute, Second | HH:mm:ss               | 13:47:20                     |\n *\n * Note that the year is always four-digits, milliseconds (if it's added) is always\n * three-digits, and all others are always two-digits. So the number representing\n * January always has a leading zero, such as `01`. Additionally, the hour is always\n * in the 24-hour format, so `00` is `12am` on a 12-hour clock, `13` means `1pm`,\n * and `23` means `11pm`.\n *\n * It's also important to note that neither the `displayFormat` or `pickerFormat` can\n * set the datetime value's output, which is the value that is set by the component's\n * `ngModel`. The format's are merely for displaying the value as text and the picker's\n * interface, but the datetime's value is always persisted as a valid ISO 8601 datetime\n * string.\n *\n *\n * ## Min and Max Datetimes\n *\n * Dates are infinite in either direction, so for a user's selection there should be at\n * least some form of restricting the dates that can be selected. Be default, the maximum\n * date is to the end of the current year, and the minimum date is from the beginning\n * of the year that was 100 years ago.\n *\n * To customize the minimum and maximum datetime values, the `min` and `max` component\n * inputs can be provided which may make more sense for the app's use-case, rather\n * than the default of the last 100 years. Following the same IS0 8601 format listed\n * in the table above, each component can restrict which dates can be selected by the\n * user. Below is an example of restricting the date selection between the beginning\n * of 2016, and October 31st of 2020:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Date</ion-label>\n *   <ion-datetime displayFormat=\"MMMM YYYY\" min=\"2016\" max=\"2020-10-31\" [(ngModel)]=\"myDate\">\n *   </ion-datetime>\n * </ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ## Month Names and Day of the Week Names\n *\n * At this time, there is no one-size-fits-all standard to automatically choose the correct\n * language/spelling for a month name, or day of the week name, depending on the language\n * or locale. Good news is that there is an\n * [Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat)\n * standard which *most* browsers have adopted. However, at this time the standard has not\n * been fully implemented by all popular browsers so Ionic is unavailable to take advantage\n * of it *yet*. Additionally, Angular also provides an internationalization service, but it\n * is still under heavy development so Ionic does not depend on it at this time.\n *\n * All things considered, the by far easiest solution is to just provide an array of names\n * if the app needs to use names other than the default English version of month and day\n * names. The month names and day names can be either configured at the app level, or\n * individual `ion-datetime` level.\n *\n * ### App Config Level\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { ionicBootstrap } from 'ionic-angular';\n *\n * ionicBootstrap(MyApp, customProviders, {\n *   monthNames: ['janeiro', 'fevereiro', 'mar\\u00e7o', ... ],\n *   monthShortNames: ['jan', 'fev', 'mar', ... ],\n *   dayNames: ['domingo', 'segunda-feira', 'ter\\u00e7a-feira', ... ],\n *   dayShortNames: ['dom', 'seg', 'ter', ... ],\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ### Component Input Level\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Período</ion-label>\n *   <ion-datetime displayFormat=\"DDDD MMM D, YYYY\" [(ngModel)]=\"myDate\"\n *     monthNames=\"janeiro, fevereiro, mar\\u00e7o, ...\"\n *     monthShortNames=\"jan, fev, mar, ...\"\n *     dayNames=\"domingo, segunda-feira, ter\\u00e7a-feira, ...\"\n *     dayShortNames=\"dom, seg, ter, ...\"></ion-datetime>\n * </ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Advanced Datetime Validation and Manipulation\n *\n * The datetime picker provides the simplicity of selecting an exact format, and persists\n * the datetime values as a string using the standardized\n * [ISO 8601 datetime format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).\n * However, it's important to note that `ion-datetime` does not attempt to solve all\n * situtations when validating and manipulating datetime values. If datetime values need\n * to be parsed from a certain format, or manipulated (such as adding 5 days to a date,\n * subtracting 30 minutes, etc.), or even formatting data to a specific locale, then we highly\n * recommend using [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) to \"Parse, validate, manipulate, and\n * display dates in JavaScript\". [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) has quickly become\n * our goto standard when dealing with datetimes within JavaScript, but Ionic does not\n * prepackage this dependency since most apps will not require it, and its locale\n * configuration should be decided by the end-developer.\n *\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Date</ion-label>\n *   <ion-datetime displayFormat=\"MM/DD/YYYY\" [(ngModel)]=\"myDate\">\n *   </ion-datetime>\n * </ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/datetime/\n */\nexport var DateTime = (function () {\n    function DateTime(_form, _config, _item, _pickerCtrl) {\n        this._form = _form;\n        this._config = _config;\n        this._item = _item;\n        this._pickerCtrl = _pickerCtrl;\n        this._disabled = false;\n        this._text = '';\n        this._isOpen = false;\n        this._value = {};\n        this._locale = {};\n        /**\n         * @input {string} The display format of the date and time as text that shows\n         * within the item.

It requires\n * an [Item](../Item) component as a child and a [List](../../list/List) component as\n * a parent. All buttons to reveal can be placed in the `<ion-item-options>` element.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n * <ion-list>\n *   <ion-item-sliding #item>\n *     <ion-item>\n *       Item\n *     </ion-item>\n *     <ion-item-options side=\"left\">\n *       <button (click)=\"favorite(item)\">Favorite</button>\n *       <button danger (click)=\"share(item)\">Share</button>\n *     </ion-item-options>\n\n *     <ion-item-options side=\"right\">\n *       <button (click)=\"unread(item)\">Unread</button>\n *     </ion-item-options>\n *   </ion-item-sliding>\n * </ion-list>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Swipe Direction\n * By default, the buttons are revealed when the sliding item is swiped from right to left,\n * so the buttons are placed in the right side. But it's also possible to reveal them\n * in the right side (sliding from left to right) by setting the `side` attribute\n * on the `ion-item-options` element. Up to 2 `ion-item-options` can used at the same time\n * in order to reveal two different sets of buttons depending the swipping direction.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item-options side=\"right\">\n *   <button (click)=\"archive(item)\">\n *     <ion-icon name=\"archive\"></ion-icon>\n *     Archive\n *   </button>\n * </ion-item-options>\n\n * <ion-item-options side=\"left\">\n *   <button (click)=\"archive(item)\">\n *     <ion-icon name=\"archive\"></ion-icon>\n *     Archive\n *   </button>\n * </ion-item-options>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Listening for events (ionDrag) and (ionSwipe)\n * It's possible to know the current relative position of the sliding item by subscribing\n * to the (ionDrag)` event.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item-sliding (ionDrag)=\"logDrag($event)\">\n *   <ion-item>Item</ion-item>\n *   <ion-item-options>\n *     <button>Favorite</button>\n *   </ion-item-options>\n * </ion-item-sliding>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Button Layout\n * If an icon is placed with text in the option button, by default it will\n * display the icon on top of the text. This can be changed to display the icon\n * to the left of the text by setting `icon-left` as an attribute on the\n * `<ion-item-options>` element.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item-options icon-left>\n *    <button (click)=\"archive(item)\">\n *      <ion-icon name=\"archive\"></ion-icon>\n *      Archive\n *    </button>\n *  </ion-item-options>\n *\n * ```\n *\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/item-sliding/\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#lists List Component Docs}\n * @see {@link ../Item Item API Docs}\n * @see {@link ../../list/List List API Docs}\n */\nexport var ItemSliding = (function () {\n    function ItemSliding(list, _renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._openAmount = 0;\n        this._startX = 0;\n        this._optsWidthRightSide = 0;\n        this._optsWidthLeftSide = 0;\n        this._timer = null;\n        this._optsDirty = true;\n        this._state = SlidingState.Disabled;\n        /**\n         * @output {event} Expression to evaluate when the sliding position changes.\n         * It reports the relative position.\n         *\n         * ```ts\n         * ondrag(item) {\n         *   let percent = item.getSlidingPercent();\n         *   if (percent > 0) {\n         *     // positive\n         *     console.log('right side');\n         *   } else {\n         *     // negative\n         *     console.log('left side');\n         *   }\n         *   if (Math.abs(percent) > 1) {\n         *     console.log('overscroll');\n         *   }\n         * }\n         * ```\n         *\n         */\n        this.ionDrag = new EventEmitter();\n        list && list.containsSlidingItem(true);\n        _elementRef.nativeElement.$ionComponent = this;\n        this.setCssClass('item-wrapper', true);\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(ItemSliding.prototype, \"_itemOptions\", {\n        set: function (itemOptions) {\n            var sides = 0;\n            for (var _i = 0, _a = itemOptions.toArray(); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n                var item = _a[_i];\n                var side = item.getSides();\n                if (side === ItemSideFlags.Left) {\n                    this._leftOptions = item;\n                }\n                else {\n                    this._rightOptions = item;\n                }\n                sides |= item.getSides();\n            }\n            this._optsDirty = true;\n            this._sides = sides;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @private\n     */\n    ItemSliding.prototype.getOpenAmount = function () {\n        return this._openAmount;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @private\n     */\n    ItemSliding.prototype.getSlidingPercent = function () {\n        var openAmount = this._openAmount;\n        if (openAmount > 0) {\n            return openAmount / this._optsWidthRightSide;\n        }\n        else if (openAmount < 0) {\n            return openAmount / this._optsWidthLeftSide;\n        }\n        else {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @private\n     */\n    ItemSliding.prototype.startSliding = function (startX) {\n        if (this._timer) {\n            clearNativeTimeout(this._timer);\n            this._timer = null;\n        }\n        if (this._openAmount === 0) {\n            this._optsDirty = true;\n            this._setState(SlidingState.Enabled);\n        }\n        this._startX = startX + this._openAmount;\n        this.item.setCssStyle(CSS.transition, 'none');\n    };\n    /**\n     * @private\n     */\n    ItemSliding.prototype.moveSliding = function (x) {\n        if (this._optsDirty) {\n            this.calculateOptsWidth();\n            return;\n        }\n        var openAmount = (this._startX - x);\n        switch (this._sides) {\n            case ItemSideFlags.Right:\n                openAmount = Math.max(0, openAmount);\n                break;\n            case ItemSideFlags.Left:\n                openAmount = Math.min(0, openAmount);\n                break;\n            case ItemSideFlags.Both: break;\n            default: return;\n        }\n        if (openAmount > this._optsWidthRightSide) {\n            var optsWidth = this._optsWidthRightSide;\n            openAmount = optsWidth + (openAmount - optsWidth) * ELASTIC_FACTOR;\n        }\n        else if (openAmount < -this._optsWidthLeftSide) {\n            var optsWidth = -this._optsWidthLeftSide;\n            openAmount = optsWidth + (openAmount - optsWidth) * ELASTIC_FACTOR;\n        }\n        this._setOpenAmount(openAmount, false);\n        return openAmount;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @private\n     */\n    ItemSliding.prototype.endSliding = function (velocity) {\n        var restingPoint = (this._openAmount > 0)\n            ?

The loading indicator appears on top of the app's content,\n * and can be dismissed by the app to resume user interaction with\n * the app. It includes an optional backdrop, which can be disabled\n * by setting `showBackdrop: false` upon creation.\n *\n * ### Creating\n * You can pass all of the loading options in the first argument of\n * the create method: `create(opts)`. The spinner name should be\n * passed in the `spinner` property, and any optional HTML can be passed\n * in the `content` property. If you do not pass a value to `spinner`\n * the loading indicator will use the spinner specified by the mode. To\n * set the spinner name across the app, set the value of `loadingSpinner`\n * in your app's config. To hide the spinner, set `loadingSpinner: 'hide'`\n * in the app's config or pass `spinner: 'hide'` in the loading\n * options. See the [create](#create) method below for all available options.\n *\n * ### Dismissing\n * The loading indicator can be dismissed automatically after a specific\n * amount of time by passing the number of milliseconds to display it in\n * the `duration` of the loading options. By default the loading indicator\n * will show even during page changes, but this can be disabled by setting\n * `dismissOnPageChange` to `true`. To dismiss the loading indicator after\n * creation, call the `dismiss()` method on the Loading instance. The\n * `onDidDismiss` function can be called to perform an action after the loading\n * indicator is dismissed.\n *\n * >Note that after the component is dismissed, it will not be usable anymore\n * and another one must be created. This can be avoided by wrapping the\n * creation and presentation of the component in a reusable function as shown\n * in the `usage` section below.\n *\n * ### Limitations\n * The element is styled to appear on top of other content by setting its\n * `z-index` property. You must ensure no element has a stacking context with\n * a higher `z-index` than this element.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```ts\n * constructor(private loadingCtrl: LoadingController) {\n *\n * }\n *\n * presentLoadingDefault() {\n *   let loading = this.loadingCtrl.create({\n *     content: 'Please wait...'\n *   });\n *\n *   loading.present();\n *\n *   setTimeout(() => {\n *     loading.dismiss();\n *   }, 5000);\n * }\n *\n * presentLoadingCustom() {\n *   let loading = this.loadingCtrl.create({\n *     spinner: 'hide',\n *     content: `\n *       <div class=\"custom-spinner-container\">\n *         <div class=\"custom-spinner-box\"></div>\n *       </div>`,\n *     duration: 5000\n *   });\n *\n *   loading.onDidDismiss(() => {\n *     console.log('Dismissed loading');\n *   });\n *\n *   loading.present();\n * }\n *\n * presentLoadingText() {\n *   let loading = this.loadingCtrl.create({\n *     spinner: 'hide',\n *     content: 'Loading Please Wait...'\n *   });\n *\n *   loading.present();\n *\n *   setTimeout(() => {\n *     this.nav.push(Page2);\n *   }, 1000);\n *\n *   setTimeout(() => {\n *     loading.dismiss();\n *   }, 5000);\n * }\n * ```\n * @advanced\n *\n * Loading options\n *\n * | Option                | Type       | Description                                                                                                      |\n * |-----------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | spinner               |`string`    | The name of the SVG spinner for the loading indicator.                                                           |\n * | content               |`string`    | The html content for the loading indicator.                                                                      |\n * | cssClass              |`string`    | An additional class for custom styles.                                                                           |\n * | showBackdrop          |`boolean`   | Whether to show the backdrop.

By default, it slides in from the left, but the side can be overridden. The menu\n * will be displayed differently based on the mode, however the display type can be changed\n * to any of the available [menu types](#menu-types). The menu element should be a sibling\n * to the app's content element. There can be any number of menus attached to the content.\n * These can be controlled from the templates, or programmatically using the [MenuController](../MenuController).\n *\n *\n * ### Opening/Closing Menus\n *\n * There are several ways to open or close a menu. The menu can be **toggled** open or closed\n * from the template using the [MenuToggle](../MenuToggle) directive. It can also be\n * **closed** from the template using the [MenuClose](../MenuClose) directive. To display a menu\n * programmatically, inject the [MenuController](../MenuController) provider and call any of the\n * `MenuController` methods.\n *\n *\n * ### Menu Types\n *\n * The menu supports several display types: `overlay`, `reveal` and `push`. By default,\n * it will use the correct type based on the mode, but this can be changed. The default\n * type for both Material Design and Windows mode is `overlay`, and `reveal` is the default\n * type for iOS mode. The menu type can be changed in the app's [config](../../config/Config)\n * via the `menuType` property, or passed in the `type` property on the `<ion-menu>` element.\n * See [usage](#usage) below for examples of changing the menu type.\n *\n *\n * ### Navigation Bar Behavior\n *\n * If a [MenuToggle](../MenuToggle) button is added to the [NavBar](../../nav/NavBar) of\n * a page, the button will only appear when the page it's in is currently a root page. The\n * root page is the initial page loaded in the app, or a page that has been set as the root\n * using the [setRoot](../../nav/NavController/#setRoot) method on the [NavController](../../nav/NavController).\n *\n * For example, say the application has two pages, `Page1` and `Page2`, and both have a\n * `MenuToggle` button in their navigation bars. Assume the initial page loaded into the app\n * is `Page1`, making it the root page. `Page1` will display the `MenuToggle` button, but once\n * `Page2` is pushed onto the navigation stack, the `MenuToggle` will not be displayed.\n *\n *\n * ### Persistent Menus\n *\n * Persistent menus display the [MenuToggle](../MenuToggle) button in the [NavBar](../../nav/NavBar)\n * on all pages in the navigation stack. To make a menu persistent set `persistent` to `true` on the\n * `<ion-menu>` element. Note that this will only affect the `MenuToggle` button in the `NavBar` attached\n * to the `Menu` with `persistent` set to true, any other `MenuToggle` buttons will not be affected.\n *\n *\n * @usage\n *\n * To add a menu to an application, the `<ion-menu>` element should be added as a sibling to\n * the content it belongs to. A [local variable](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/user-input.html#local-variables)\n * should be added to the content element and passed to the menu element in the `content` property.\n * This tells the menu which content it is attached to, so it knows which element to watch for\n * gestures. In the below example, `content` is using [property binding](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html#!#property-binding)\n * because `mycontent` is a reference to the `<ion-nav>` element, and not a string.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu [content]=\"mycontent\">\n *   <ion-content>\n *     <ion-list>\n *     ...\n *     </ion-list>\n *   </ion-content>\n * </ion-menu>\n *\n * <ion-nav #mycontent [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Menu Side\n *\n * By default, menus slide in from the left, but this can be overridden by passing `right`\n * to the `side` property:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu side=\"right\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Menu Type\n *\n * The menu type can be changed by passing the value to `type` on the `<ion-menu>`:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu type=\"overlay\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * ```\n *\n * It can also be set in the app's config. The below will set the menu type to\n * `push` for all modes, and then set the type to `overlay` for the `ios` mode.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { ionicBootstrap } from 'ionic-angular';\n *\n * ionicBootstrap(MyApp, customProviders, {\n *   menuType: 'push',\n *   platforms: {\n *     ios: {\n *       menuType: 'overlay',\n *     }\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Displaying the Menu\n *\n * To toggle a menu from the template, add a button with the `menuToggle`\n * directive anywhere in the page's template:\n *\n * ```html\n * <button menuToggle>Toggle Menu</button>\n * ```\n *\n * To close a menu, add the `menuClose` button. It can be added anywhere\n * in the content, or even the menu itself. Below it is added to the menu's\n * content:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu [content]=\"mycontent\">\n *   <ion-content>\n *     <ion-list>\n *       <button menuClose ion-item detail-none>Close Menu</button>\n *     </ion-list>\n *   </ion-content>\n * </ion-menu>\n * ```\n *\n * See the [MenuToggle](../MenuToggle) and [MenuClose](../MenuClose) docs\n * for more information on these directives.\n *\n * The menu can also be controlled from the Page by using the `MenuController`.\n * Inject the `MenuController` provider into the page and then call any of its\n * methods. In the below example, the `openMenu` method will open the menu\n * when it is called.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n * import { MenuController } from 'ionic-angular';\n *\n * @Component({...})\n * export class MyPage {\n *  constructor(private menu: MenuController) {}\n *\n *  openMenu() {\n *    this.menu.open();\n *  }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * See the [MenuController](../MenuController) API docs for all of the methods\n * and usage information.\n *\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/menu/\n *\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#menus Menu Component Docs}\n * @see {@link ../MenuController MenuController API Docs}\n * @see {@link ../../nav/Nav Nav API Docs}\n * @see {@link ../../nav/NavController NavController API Docs}\n */\nexport var Menu = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(Menu, _super);\n    function Menu(_menuCtrl, _elementRef, _config, _platform, _renderer, _keyboard, _zone) {\n        _super.call(this, _elementRef);\n        this._menuCtrl = _menuCtrl;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._config = _config;\n        this._platform = _platform;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._keyboard = _keyboard;\n        this._zone = _zone;\n        this._preventTime = 0;\n        this._isEnabled = true;\n        this._isSwipeEnabled = true;\n        this._isPers = false;\n        this._init = false;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         */\n        this.isOpen = false;\n        /**\n         * @output {event} When the menu is being dragged open.\n         */\n        this.ionDrag = new EventEmitter();\n        /**\n         * @output {event} When the menu has been opened.\n         */\n        this.ionOpen = new EventEmitter();\n        /**\n         * @output {event} When the menu has been closed.\n         */\n        this.ionClose = new EventEmitter();\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(Menu.prototype, \"enabled\", {\n        /**\n         * @input {boolean} Whether or not the menu should be enabled.

A modal uses the\n * `NavController` to\n * {@link /docs/v2/api/components/nav/NavController/#present present}\n * itself in the root nav stack. It is added to the stack similar to how\n * {@link /docs/v2/api/components/nav/NavController/#push NavController.push}\n * works.\n *\n * When a modal (or any other overlay such as an alert or actionsheet) is\n * \"presented\" to a nav controller, the overlay is added to the app's root nav.\n * After the modal has been presented, from within the component instance The\n * modal can later be closed or \"dismissed\" by using the ViewController's\n * `dismiss` method. Additionally, you can dismiss any overlay by using `pop`\n * on the root nav controller.\n *\n * Data can be passed to a new modal through `Modal.create()` as the second\n * argument. The data can then be accessed from the opened page by injecting\n * `NavParams`. Note that the page, which opened as a modal, has no special\n * \"modal\" logic within it, but uses `NavParams` no differently than a\n * standard page.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```ts\n * import { ModalController, NavParams } from 'ionic-angular';\n *\n * @Component(...)\n * class HomePage {\n *\n *  constructor(private modalCtrl: ModalController) {\n *\n *  }\n *\n *  presentProfileModal() {\n *    let profileModal = this.modalCtrl.create(Profile, { userId: 8675309 });\n *    profileModal.present();\n *  }\n *\n * }\n *\n * @Component(...)\n * class Profile {\n *\n *  constructor(params: NavParams) {\n *    console.log('UserId', params.get('userId'));\n *  }\n *\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @advanced\n *\n * | Option                | Type       | Description                                                                                                      |\n * |-----------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | showBackdrop          |`boolean`   | Whether to show the backdrop.

As a subclass of NavController\n * you use it to navigate to pages in your app and manipulate the navigation stack.\n * Nav automatically animates transitions between pages for you.\n *\n * For more information on using navigation controllers like Nav or [Tab](../../Tabs/Tab/),\n * take a look at the [NavController API Docs](../NavController/).\n *\n * You must set a root page to be loaded initially by any Nav you create, using\n * the 'root' property:\n *\n * @usage\n * ```ts\n * import {Component} from '@angular/core';\n * import {ionicBootstrap} from 'ionic-angular';\n * import {GettingStartedPage} from './getting-started';\n *\n * @Component({\n *   template: `<ion-nav [root]=\"root\"></ion-nav>`\n * })\n * class MyApp {\n *   root = GettingStartedPage;\n * }\n *\n * ionicBootstrap(MyApp);\n * ```\n *\n * ### Back Navigation\n *\n * If a [page](../NavController/#creating_pages) you navigate to has a [NavBar](../NavBar/),\n * Nav will automatically add a back button to it if there is a page\n * before the one you are navigating to in the navigation stack.\n *\n * Additionally, specifying the `swipeBackEnabled` property will allow you to\n * swipe to go back:\n * ```html\n * <ion-nav swipeBackEnabled=\"false\" [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>\n * ```\n *\n * Here is a diagram of how Nav animates smoothly between pages:\n *\n * <div class=\"highlight

The view\n * to display in the popover should be passed as the first argument.\n * Any data to pass to the popover view can optionally be passed in\n * the second argument. Options for the popover can optionally be\n * passed in the third argument. See the [create](#create) method\n * below for all available options.\n *\n * ### Presenting\n * To present a popover, call the `present` method on the [NavController](../../nav/NavController).\n * The first argument passed to the `present` should be the popover. In order\n * to position the popover relative to the element clicked, the event needs to be\n * passed as the second argument. If the event is not passed, the popover will be\n * positioned in the center of the current view. See the [usage](#usage) section for\n * an example of passing this event.\n *\n * ### Dismissing\n * To dismiss the popover after creation, call the `dismiss()` method on the\n * `Popover` instance. The popover can also be dismissed from within the popover's\n * view by calling the `dismiss()` method on the [ViewController](../../nav/ViewController).\n * The `onDidDismiss` function can be called to perform an action after the popover\n * is dismissed. The popover will dismiss when the backdrop is clicked, but this\n * can be disabled by setting `enableBackdropDismiss` to `false` in the popover\n * options.\n *\n * > Note that after the component is dismissed, it will not be usable anymore and\n * another one must be created. This can be avoided by wrapping the creation and\n * presentation of the component in a reusable function as shown in the [usage](#usage)\n * section below.\n *\n * @usage\n *\n * To open a popover on the click of a button, pass `$event` to the method\n * which creates and presents the popover:\n *\n * ```html\n * <button (click)=\"presentPopover($event)\">\n *   <ion-icon name=\"more\"></ion-icon>\n * </button>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * @Component({})\n * class MyPage {\n *   constructor(private popoverCtrl: PopoverController) {}\n *\n *   presentPopover(myEvent) {\n *     let popover = this.popoverCtrl.create(PopoverPage);\n *     popover.present({\n *       ev: myEvent\n *     });\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The `PopoverPage` will display inside of the popover, and\n * can be anything. Below is an example of a page with items\n * that close the popover on click.\n *\n * ```ts\n * @Component({\n *   template: `\n *     <ion-list>\n *       <ion-list-header>Ionic</ion-list-header>\n *       <button ion-item (click)=\"close()\">Learn Ionic</button>\n *       <button ion-item (click)=\"close()\">Documentation</button>\n *       <button ion-item (click)=\"close()\">Showcase</button>\n *       <button ion-item (click)=\"close()\">GitHub Repo</button>\n *     </ion-list>\n *   `\n * })\n * class PopoverPage {\n *   constructor(private viewCtrl: ViewController) {}\n *\n *   close() {\n *     this.viewCtrl.dismiss();\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * @advanced\n * Popover Options\n *\n * | Option                | Type       | Description                                                                                                      |\n * |-----------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | cssClass              |`string`    | An additional class for custom styles.                                                                           |\n * | showBackdrop          |`boolean`   | Whether to show the backdrop.

It can accept dual knobs, but by default one knob\n * controls the value of the range.\n *\n * ### Range Labels\n * Labels can be placed on either side of the range by adding the\n * `range-left` or `range-right` property to the element. The element\n * doesn't have to be an `ion-label`, it can be added to any element\n * to place it to the left or right of the range. See [usage](#usage)\n * below for examples.\n *\n *\n * ### Minimum and Maximum Values\n * Minimum and maximum values can be passed to the range through the `min`\n * and `max` properties, respectively. By default, the range sets the `min`\n * to `0` and the `max` to `100`.\n *\n *\n * ### Steps and Snaps\n * The `step` property specifies the value granularity of the range's value.\n * It can be useful to set the `step` when the value isn't in increments of `1`.\n * Setting the `step` property will show tick marks on the range for each step.\n * The `snaps` property can be set to automatically move the knob to the nearest\n * tick mark based on the step property value.\n *\n *\n * ### Dual Knobs\n * Setting the `dualKnobs` property to `true` on the range component will\n * enable two knobs on the range. If the range has two knobs, the value will\n * be an object containing two properties: `lower` and `upper`.\n *\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n * <ion-list>\n *   <ion-item>\n *     <ion-range [(ngModel)]=\"singleValue\" danger pin=\"true\"></ion-range>\n *   </ion-item>\n *\n *   <ion-item>\n *     <ion-range min=\"-200\" max=\"200\" [(ngModel)]=\"saturation\" secondary>\n *       <ion-label range-left>-200</ion-label>\n *       <ion-label range-right>200</ion-label>\n *     </ion-range>\n *   </ion-item>\n *\n *  <ion-item>\n *    <ion-range min=\"20\" max=\"80\" step=\"2\" [(ngModel)]=\"brightness\">\n *      <ion-icon small range-left name=\"sunny\"></ion-icon>\n *      <ion-icon range-right name=\"sunny\"></ion-icon>\n *    </ion-range>\n *  </ion-item>\n *\n *   <ion-item>\n *     <ion-label>step=100, snaps, {{singleValue4}}</ion-label>\n *     <ion-range min=\"1000\" max=\"2000\" step=\"100\" snaps=\"true\" secondary [(ngModel)]=\"singleValue4\"></ion-range>\n *   </ion-item>\n *\n *   <ion-item>\n *     <ion-label>dual, step=3, snaps, {{dualValue2 | json}}</ion-label>\n *     <ion-range dualKnobs=\"true\" [(ngModel)]=\"dualValue2\" min=\"21\" max=\"72\" step=\"3\" snaps=\"true\"></ion-range>\n *   </ion-item>\n * </ion-list>\n * ```\n *\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/range/\n */\nexport var Range = (function () {\n    function Range(_form, _item, _renderer) {\n        this._form = _form;\n        this._item = _item;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._dual = false;\n        this._disabled = false;\n        this._start = null;\n        this._min = 0;\n        this._max = 100;\n        this._step = 1;\n        this._snaps = false;\n        this._debouncer = new Debouncer(0);\n        this._events = new UIEventManager();\n        /**\n         * @output {Range} Expression to evaluate when the range value changes.\n         */\n        this.ionChange = new EventEmitter();\n        _form.register(this);\n        if (_item) {\n            this.id = 'rng-' + _item.registerInput('range');\n            this._labelId = 'lbl-' + _item.id;\n            _item.setCssClass('item-range', true);\n        }\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(Range.prototype, \"min\", {\n        /**\n         * @input {number} Minimum integer value of the range.

When users tap the select component, a\n * dialog will appear with all of the options in a large, easy to select list\n * for users.\n *\n * The select component takes child `ion-option` components. If `ion-option` is not\n * given a `value` attribute then it will use its text as the value.\n *\n * ### Interfaces\n *\n * By default, the `ion-select` uses the {@link ../../alert/Alert Alert API} to\n * open up the overlay of options in an alert. The interface can be changed to use the\n * {@link ../../action-sheet/ActionSheet ActionSheet API} by passing `action-sheet` to\n * the `interface` property. Read the other sections for the limitations of the\n * action sheet interface.\n *\n * ### Single Value: Radio Buttons\n *\n * The standard `ion-select` component allows the user to select only one\n * option. When selecting only one option the alert interface presents users with\n * a radio button styled list of options. The action sheet interface can only be\n * used with a single value select. If the number of options exceed 6, it will\n * use the `alert` interface even if `action-sheet` is passed. The `ion-select`\n * component's value receives the value of the selected option's value.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Gender</ion-label>\n *   <ion-select [(ngModel)]=\"gender\">\n *     <ion-option value=\"f\" checked=\"true\">Female</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option value=\"m\">Male</ion-option>\n *   </ion-select>\n * </ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Multiple Value: Checkboxes\n *\n * By adding the `multiple=\"true\"` attribute to `ion-select`, users are able\n * to select multiple options. When multiple options can be selected, the alert\n * overlay presents users with a checkbox styled list of options. The\n * `ion-select multiple=\"true\"` component's value receives an array of all the\n * selected option values. In the example below, because each option is not given\n * a `value`, then it'll use its text as the value instead.\n *\n * Note: the action sheet interface will not work with a multi-value select.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Toppings</ion-label>\n *   <ion-select [(ngModel)]=\"toppings\" multiple=\"true\">\n *     <ion-option>Bacon</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Black Olives</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Extra Cheese</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Mushrooms</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Pepperoni</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Sausage</ion-option>\n *   </ion-select>\n * </ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Select Buttons\n * By default, the two buttons read `Cancel` and `OK`. Each button's text\n * can be customized using the `cancelText` and `okText` attributes:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-select okText=\"Okay\" cancelText=\"Dismiss\">\n *   ...\n * </ion-select>\n * ```\n *\n * The action sheet interface does not have an `OK` button, clicking\n * on any of the options will automatically close the overlay and select\n * that value.\n *\n * ### Alert Options\n *\n * Since `ion-select` is a wrapper to `Alert`, by default, it can be\n * passed options in the `alertOptions` property. This can be used to\n * pass a custom alert title, subtitle or message. See the {@link ../../alert/Alert Alert API docs}\n * for more properties.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-select [alertOptions]=\"alertOptions\">\n *   ...\n * </ion-select>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.alertOptions = {\n *   title: 'Pizza Toppings',\n *   subTitle: 'Select your toppings'\n * };\n * ```\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/select/\n */\nexport var Select = (function () {\n    function Select(_app, _form, _elementRef, _renderer, _item, _nav) {\n        this._app = _app;\n        this._form = _form;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._item = _item;\n        this._nav = _nav;\n        this._disabled = false;\n        this._multi = false;\n        this._values = [];\n        this._texts = [];\n        this._text = '';\n        this._isOpen = false;\n        /**\n         * @input {string} The text to display on the cancel button.

Each section can be swiped\n * or dragged between. It contains any number of [Slide](../Slide) components.\n *\n *\n * ### Creating\n * You should use a template to create slides and listen to slide events. The template\n * should contain the slide container, an `<ion-slides>` element, and any number of\n * [Slide](../Slide) components, written as `<ion-slide>`. Any configuration of the\n * slides should be passed in the `options` property of the `<ion-slides>` element.\n * You can listen to events such as the slide changing by placing the event on the\n * `<ion-slides>` element. See [Usage](#usage) below for more information on\n * creating slides.\n *\n *\n * ### Configuring\n * There are several configuration options that can be passed to Slides. These should\n * be passed in the `options` property of the `<ion-slides>` element upon creation.\n * You can allow the slides to loop around from the last to the first, set autoplay\n * on the slides so it will automatically switch between them, and more.\n *\n * Properties to pass in options:\n *\n * | Property              | Type      | Default        | Description                                                                                |\n * |-----------------------|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | autoplay              | `number`  | -              | Delay between transitions (in ms). If this parameter is not passed, autoplay is disabled.  |\n * | direction             | `string`  | 'horizontal'   | Swipe direction: 'horizontal' or 'vertical'.                                               |\n * | initialSlide          | `number`  | 0              | Index number of initial slide                                                              |\n * | loop                  | `boolean` | false          | Whether to continuously loop from the last slide to the first slide.                       |\n * | pager                 | `boolean` | false          | Show the pagination bullets.                                                               |\n * | speed                 | `number`  | 300            | Duration of transition between slides (in ms).                                             |\n *\n * See [Usage](#usage) below for more information on configuring slides.\n *\n *\n * ### Navigating\n * After creating and configuring the slides, you can navigate between them\n * by swiping or calling methods on the `Slides` instance. You can call `slideTo()` to\n * navigate to a specific slide, or `slideNext()` to change to the slide that follows\n * the active slide. All of the [methods](#instance-members) provided by the `Slides`\n * instance are listed below. See [Usage](#usage) below for more information on\n * navigating between slides.\n *\n *\n * ### Limitations\n * The Slides component wraps the [Swiper](http://www.idangero.us/swiper/) component\n * built by iDangero.us. This means that all of the Swiper API isn't exposed on the\n * Slides component. See the [`getSlider()`](#getSlider) method for information on\n * getting the `Swiper` instance and using its methods directly.\n *\n *\n * @usage\n *\n * You can add slides to a `@Component` using the following template:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-slides>\n *   <ion-slide>\n *     <h1>Slide 1</h1>\n *   </ion-slide>\n *   <ion-slide>\n *     <h1>Slide 2</h1>\n *   </ion-slide>\n *   <ion-slide>\n *     <h1>Slide 3</h1>\n *   </ion-slide>\n * </ion-slides>\n * ```\n *\n * To add [options](#configuring), we will define them in `mySlideOptions` in our class `MyPage`:\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {Component} from '@angular/core';\n * import {Slides} from 'ionic-angular';\n *\n * @Component({\n *   templateUrl: 'my-page.html'\n * })\n * class MyPage {\n *   mySlideOptions = {\n *     initialSlide: 1,\n *     loop: true\n *   };\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * This is setting the second slide as the initial slide on load, since\n * the `initialSlide` begins at `0`. We are also setting `loop` to true which\n * allows us to swipe from the last slide to the first continuously. Then,\n * we will pass `mySlideOptions` in the `options` property of the `<ion-slides>`\n * element. We are using [property binding](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html#!#property-binding)\n * on `options` because `mySlideOptions` is an expression:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-slides [options]=\"mySlideOptions\">\n * ```\n *\n * To grab a reference to the Slides, we will add a [local template variable](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html#!#local-vars)\n * to `<ion-slides>` called `mySlider`:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-slides #mySlider [options]=\"mySlideOptions\">\n * ```\n *\n * Next, we can use `ViewChild` to assign the Slides instance to `slider`:\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {ViewChild} from '@angular/core';\n *\n * class MyPage {\n *   @ViewChild('mySlider') slider: Slides;\n *\n *   ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Now we can call any of the `Slider` [methods]((#instance-members)),\n * for example we can use the Slider's `slideTo()` method in order to\n * navigate to a specific slide on a button click. Below we call the\n * `goToSlide()` method and it navigates to the 3rd slide:\n *\n * ```ts\n * class MyPage {\n *   ...\n *\n *   goToSlide() {\n *     this.slider.slideTo(2, 500);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can also add events to listen to on the `<ion-slides>` element.\n * Let's add the `ionDidChange` event and call a method when the slide changes:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-slides #mySlider (ionDidChange)=\"onSlideChanged()\" [options]=\"mySlideOptions\">\n * ```\n *\n * In our class, we add the `onSlideChanged()` method which gets the active\n * index and prints it:\n *\n * ```ts\n * class MyPage {\n *   ...\n *\n *   onSlideChanged() {\n *     let currentIndex = this.slider.getActiveIndex();\n *     console.log(\"Current index is\", currentIndex);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * For all of the methods you can call on the `Slider` instance, see the\n * [Instance Members](#instance-members).\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/slides/\n * @see {@link

The toast appears on top of the app's content,\n * and can be dismissed by the app to resume user interaction with\n * the app.\n *\n * ### Creating\n * All of the toast options should be passed in the first argument of\n * the create method: `create(opts)`. The message to display should be\n * passed in the `message` property. The `showCloseButton` option can be set to\n * true in order to display a close button on the toast. See the [create](#create)\n * method below for all available options.\n *\n * ### Positioning\n * Toasts can be positioned at the top, bottom or middle of the\n * view port. The position can be passed to the `Toast.create(opts)` method.\n * The position option is a string, and the values accepted are `top`, `bottom` and `middle`.\n * If the position is not specified, the toast will be displayed at the bottom of the view port.\n *\n * ### Dismissing\n * The toast can be dismissed automatically after a specific amount of time\n * by passing the number of milliseconds to display it in the `duration` of\n * the toast options. If `showCloseButton` is set to true, then the close button\n * will dismiss the toast. To dismiss the toast after creation, call the `dismiss()`\n * method on the Toast instance. The `onDidDismiss` function can be called to perform an action after the toast\n * is dismissed.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```ts\n * constructor(private toastCtrl: ToastController) {\n *\n * }\n *\n * presentToast() {\n *   let toast = this.toastCtrl.create({\n *     message: 'User was added successfully',\n *     duration: 3000,\n *     position: 'top'\n *   });\n *\n *   toast.onDidDismiss(() => {\n *     console.log('Dismissed toast');\n *   });\n *\n *   toast.present();\n * }\n * ```\n * @advanced\n * | Property              | Type      | Default         | Description                                                                                                   |\n * |-----------------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | message               | `string`  | -               | The message for the toast.

An array of records\n * is passed to the virtual scroll containing the data to create templates\n * for. The template created for each record, referred to as a cell, can\n * consist of items, headers, and footers.\n *\n * For performance reasons, not every record in the list is rendered at once;\n * instead a small subset of records (enough to fill the viewport) are rendered\n * and reused as the user scrolls.\n *\n * ### The Basics\n *\n * The array of records should be passed to the `virtualScroll` property.\n * The data given to the `virtualScroll` property must be an array. An item\n * template with the `*virtualItem` property is required in the `virtualScroll`.\n * The `virtualScroll` and `*virtualItem` properties can be added to any element.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-list [virtualScroll]=\"items\">\n *\n *   <ion-item *virtualItem=\"let item\">\n *     {% raw %}{{ item }}{% endraw %}\n *   </ion-item>\n *\n * </ion-list>\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Section Headers and Footers\n *\n * Section headers and footers are optional. They can be dynamically created\n * from developer-defined functions. For example, a large list of contacts\n * usually has a divider for each letter in the alphabet. Developers provide\n * their own custom function to be called on each record. The logic in the\n * custom function should determine whether to create the section template\n * and what data to provide to the template. The custom function should\n * return `null` if a template shouldn't be created.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-list [virtualScroll]=\"items\" [headerFn]=\"myHeaderFn\">\n *\n *   <ion-item-divider *virtualHeader=\"let header\">\n *     Header: {% raw %}{{ header }}{% endraw %}\n *   </ion-item-divider>\n *\n *   <ion-item *virtualItem=\"let item\">\n *     Item: {% raw %}{{ item }}{% endraw %}\n *   </ion-item>\n *\n * </ion-list>\n * ```\n *\n * Below is an example of a custom function called on every record. It\n * gets passed the individual record, the record's index number,\n * and the entire array of records. In this example, after every 20\n * records a header will be inserted. So between the 19th and 20th records,\n * between the 39th and 40th, and so on, a `<ion-item-divider>` will\n * be created and the template's data will come from the function's\n * returned data.\n *\n * ```ts\n * myHeaderFn(record, recordIndex, records) {\n *   if (recordIndex % 20 === 0) {\n *     return 'Header ' + recordIndex;\n *   }\n *   return null;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Approximate Widths and Heights\n *\n * The approximate width and height of each template is used to help\n * determine how many cells should be created, and to help calculate\n * the height of the scrollable area. Note that the actual rendered size\n * of each cell comes from the app's CSS, whereas this approximation\n * is only used to help calculate initial dimensions.\n *\n * It's also important to know that Ionic's default item sizes have\n * slightly different heights between platforms, which is perfectly fine.\n * An exact pixel-perfect size is not necessary, but a good estimation\n * is important. Basically if each item is roughly 500px tall, rather than\n * the default of 40px tall, it's extremely important to know for virtual\n * scroll to calculate a good height.\n *\n *\n * ### Images Within Virtual Scroll\n *\n * Ionic provides `<ion-img>` to manage HTTP requests and image rendering.\n * Additionally, it includes a customizable placeholder element which shows\n * before the image has finished loading. While scrolling through items\n * quickly, `<ion-img>` knows not to make any image requests, and only loads\n * the images that are viewable after scrolling. It's also important for app\n * developers to ensure image sizes are locked in, and after images have fully\n * loaded they do not change size and affect any other element sizes.\n *\n * We recommend using our `<ion-img>` element over the native `<img>` element\n * because when an `<img>` element is added to the DOM, it immediately\n * makes a HTTP request for the image file. HTTP requests, image\n * decoding, and image rendering can cause issues while scrolling. For virtual\n * scrolling, the natural effects of the `<img>` are not desirable features.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-list [virtualScroll]=\"items\">\n *\n *   <ion-item *virtualItem=\"let item\">\n *     <ion-avatar item-left>\n *       <ion-img [src]=\"item.avatarUrl\"></ion-img>\n *     </ion-avatar>\n *    {% raw %} {{ item.firstName }} {{ item.lastName }}{% endraw %}\n *   </ion-item>\n *\n * </ion-list>\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Performance Tips\n *\n * - Use `<ion-img>` rather than `<img>` so images are lazy loaded\n *   while scrolling.\n * - Image sizes should be locked in, meaning the size of any element\n *   should not change after the image has loaded.\n * - Provide an approximate width and height so the virtual scroll can\n *   best calculate the cell height.\n * - Changing the dataset requires the entire virtual scroll to be\n *   reset, which is an expensive operation and should be avoided\n *   if possible.\n * - Do not perform any DOM manipulation within section header and\n *   footer functions. These functions are called for every record in the\n *   dataset, so please make sure they're performant.\n *\n */\nexport var VirtualScroll = (function () {\n    function VirtualScroll(_iterableDiffers, _elementRef, _renderer, _zone, _cd, _content, _platform, _ctrl, config) {\n        this._iterableDiffers = _iterableDiffers;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._zone = _zone;\n        this._cd = _cd;\n        this._content = _content;\n        this._platform = _platform;\n        this._ctrl = _ctrl;\n        this._records = [];\n        this._cells = [];\n        this._nodes = [];\n        this._vHeight = 0;\n        this._lastCheck = 0;\n        this._data = {\n            scrollTop: 0,\n        };\n        this._queue = null;\n        /**\n         * @input {number} The buffer ratio is used to decide how many cells\n         * should get created when initially rendered.

And it can also contain\n * children.\n * A part can contain i18n property, in which case it needs to be extracted.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n * The following array of nodes will be split into four parts:\n *\n * ```\n * <a>A</a>\n * <b i18n>B</b>\n * <!-- i18n -->\n * <c>C</c>\n * D\n * <!-- /i18n -->\n * E\n * ```\n *\n * Part 1 containing the a tag.

It should be translated.\n * Part 4 containing the E text node. It should not be translated..\n *\n * It is also important to understand how we stringify nodes to create a message.\n *\n * We walk the tree and replace every element node with a placeholder. We also replace\n * all expressions in interpolation with placeholders. We also insert a placeholder element\n * to wrap a text node containing interpolation.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n * The following tree:\n *\n * ```\n * <a>A{{I}}</a><b>B</b>\n * ```\n *\n * will be stringified into:\n * ```\n * <ph name=\"e0\"><ph name=\"t1\">A<ph name=\"0\"/></ph></ph><ph name=\"e2\">B</ph>\n * ```\n *\n * This is what the algorithm does:\n *\n * 1.

The goal is to allow users to avoid the\n  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\n  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\n  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\n\n  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\n  discussion of the approach used to shim.\n\n  Shimmed features:\n\n  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\n  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\n  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\n  document level stylesheet.\n  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\n\n    :host {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n    .foo {\n      background: red;\n    }\n\n  * encapsultion: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\n  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\n  this feature.\n\n  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\n  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\n  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\n\n  div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n  x-foo div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n\n  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\n  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\n  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\n  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\n  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\n  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\n\n    div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n    div[x-foo] {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\n  selector added to them manually.\n\n  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\n  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\n  inside a shadowRoot.\n\n  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\n  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\n  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\n  (2) re-implement css in javascript.\n\n  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\n  specific to the scope in which they are working.\n\n  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\n  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\n  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\n  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\n  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\n\n    <style>\n      ::content(div) {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <content></content>\n\n  could become:\n\n    <style>\n      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\n      ::content(div) {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <div class=\"content-container\">\n      <content></content>\n    </div>\n\n  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\n  declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector\n  in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.\n*/\nexport class ShadowCss {\n    constructor() {\n        this.strictStyling = true;\n    }\n    /*\n    * Shim some cssText with the given selector.

It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can\n *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the\n *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.\n *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection\n *     domain instance.\n *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the\n *     template into it.\n *  5. It instantiates the specified component.\n *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the\n *     application.\n *\n *\n * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications\n *\n * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,\n * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be\n * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this\n * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared\n * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.\n *\n * Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are multiple\n * applications on a page, Angular treats each application injector's services as private\n * to that application.\n *\n * ## API\n *\n * - `appComponentType`: The root component which should act as the application. This is\n *   a reference to a `Type` which is annotated with `@Component(...)`.\n * - `customProviders`: An additional set of providers that can be added to the\n *   app injector to override default injection behavior.\n *\n * Returns a `Promise` of {@link ComponentRef}.\n *\n * @experimental This api cannot be used with the offline compiler and thus is still subject to\n * change.\n */\nexport function bootstrap(appComponentType, customProviders) {\n    reflector.reflectionCapabilities = new ReflectionCapabilities();\n    let providers = [\n        BROWSER_APP_PROVIDERS, BROWSER_APP_COMPILER_PROVIDERS,\n        isPresent(customProviders) ? customProviders : []\n    ];\n    var appInjector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate(providers, browserPlatform().injector);\n    return coreLoadAndBootstrap(appComponentType, appInjector);\n}\n/**\n * @experimental\n */\nexport function bootstrapWorkerUi(workerScriptUri, customProviders) {\n    var app = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([\n        WORKER_UI_APPLICATION_PROVIDERS, BROWSER_APP_COMPILER_PROVIDERS,\n        { provide: WORKER_SCRIPT, useValue: workerScriptUri },\n        isPresent(customProviders) ? customProviders : []\n    ], workerUiPlatform().injector);\n    // Return a promise so that we keep the same semantics as Dart,\n    // and we might want to wait for the app side to come up\n    // in the future...\n    return PromiseWrapper.resolve(app.get(ApplicationRef));\n}\n/**\n * @experimental\n */\nconst WORKER_APP_COMPILER_PROVIDERS = [\n    COMPILER_PROVIDERS, {\n        provide: CompilerConfig,\n        useFactory: (platformDirectives, platformPipes) => {\n            return new CompilerConfig({ platformDirectives, platformPipes });\n        },\n        deps: [PLATFORM_DIRECTIVES, PLATFORM_PIPES]\n    },\n    { provide: XHR, useClass: XHRImpl },\n    { provide: PLATFORM_DIRECTIVES, useValue: COMMON_DIRECTIVES, multi: true },\n    { provide: PLATFORM_PIPES, useValue: COMMON_PIPES, multi: true }\n];\n/**\n * @experimental\n */\nexport function bootstrapWorkerApp(appComponentType, customProviders) {\n    var appInjector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([\n        WORKER_APP_APPLICATION_PROVIDERS, WORKER_APP_COMPILER_PROVIDERS,\n        isPresent(customProviders) ? customProviders : []\n    ], workerAppPlatform().injector);\n    return coreLoadAndBootstrap(appComponentType, appInjector);\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./~/@angular/platform-browser-dynamic/esm/index.js","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.
